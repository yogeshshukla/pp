All right. Well, take care yourself. I guess that's what you're best, presence old master? A tremor in the Force. The last time felt it was in the presence of my old master. I have traced the Rebel spies to her.

The critics have been predicting the Southampton bubble to burst for weeks, but the men in red and white have kept defying the odds. Koeman knows, with 27 games to play, the job is far from complete, but even he can't resist the thought of a top-four finish.
<blockquote>I'm not looking too much at the rest of the teams, after defeat Foxes.</blockquote>
Maybe only in the aspect that I think that I haven't seen until now teams much better than Southampton. It (a top-four finish) would be fantastic. But we said before, you live game by game and we have to work hard to keep picking up these wins.

The Saints play Aston Villa, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United when the Premier League returns from the international break. Positive results in those three six-pointers and Koeman side's top-four dream will take a huge step towards becoming a reality.
<h3><strong>Fastest in every practice and qualifying session, Rosberg led the race front start to finish.</strong></h3>
The Kiama-born stunt man sized up the Olympic-spec ramp before hurtling down it on his bike at 114km/h, before flying for 114 metres and landing safely below Rosberg was that Hamilton was again demonstrably the faster of the two drivers in the race.

Nathaniel Clyne and Jose Fonte, as well as Ryan Bertrand on loan from Chelsea make up the third stingiest defence in Europe's big leagues their five goals conceded only bettered by Bayern Munich.

While Chambers was roasted by Swansea as the Gunners collapsed in Wales on Monday morning.

Equally important as the new cavalry has been Koeman's ability to take his established players to a new level something that characterised the success Rodgers experienced at Liverpool last season.

The engine room of Victor Wanyama and Morgan Schneiderlin has been central to the charge, both adding goals to their locker, and the former admits even he was worried with the high profile departures.

A lot of important first team players left the club and I was a bit worried. I was thinking: What's going on? I've never been into a club.

On New Year's Eve 2008, Maddison successful jumped to the top and back off the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, while a little over six months later he successfully backflipped across the Tower Bridge in London while the drawbridge was open.

The 51-year-old manager who enjoyed a glittering career with the Dutch national team, Ajax, PSV and <strong>Barcelona</strong> - has the team running like a well-oiled machine, and what Saints top-four rivals would give to have had the same level of success in the transfer market as the Dutchman.

Italian striker Pelle's six goals and Serbian midfielder Tadic's six assists have quickly changed that, while Shane Long.

We try to give both drivers the best possible chance to win the race," said Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe afterwards. "For Lewis, it just didn't quite work out today.
