Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I call it luck. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!

The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Red Five standing by. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Red Five standing by. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home.

Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. What?! Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You are a part of the Rebel.

I find your lack of faith disturbing.But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor!

Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like suicide. I'm trying not to, kid.

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this.
